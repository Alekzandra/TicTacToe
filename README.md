## General Info
I won't surprise anyone with that project - it a simple Tic Tac Toe game and it works exactly like you think it works.  
I surprised only myself by actually making it work :)  
Player X always starts. I know - world is not a fair place.

## Setup

## Project status
I just located some bugs in my code that make the game not working properly. Repair session is on it's way!
Update - adding some gameStatus variable made the app working OK.
